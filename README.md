##Main functions:

1.Provide a button in the pixel inspector tool that copies the current pixel 
information to the paint brush tool as the color chosen for painting. 

2.Add a slider to the paint brush user interface to control the size of the brush. 

3.Modify the paint brush tool to allow the "opacity" of the paint to be controlled. Let opacity 
be determined as a percentage between 0 and 100 which controls the blending of the paint brush 
color and the existing color of the pixels being painted. 

4.Add a new "blur" tool that acts like a paint brush but instead of painting a color it blurs 
an area of the picture. Include controls for determining the blur area size.
